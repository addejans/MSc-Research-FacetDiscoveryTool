# MSc-Research-FacetDiscoveryTool

## A Machine Learning Algorithm for the Classification of the Facets of Constraint Polytopes  _(September 2017 â€“ April 2018)_

An original algorithm for the classification of the facets of constraint polytopes. Protoyped in Python, desired final implementation in Common Lisp.

This algorithm is one piece to a multi-year and multi-collaborative research project between graduate computer science and mathematics students.  The key idea is to merge the advantages of linear-programming and constraint problems so that we are able to exploit the expression of constraint programming models while not giving up solver speed of linear models.

This project in particular was to cluster like-facets (see presentation).

In coordination with [facet discovery tool](https://github.com/jorts1114/facet-discovery-tool) for more information.

### Note:
A lot of the code presented here was for research purposes and was not intended to be reused; thus it is very sloppy.
